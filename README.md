# Weather App  

A **Weather App** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather updates for any city or current location.  

## Features  
- **Search by City**: Enter a city name to fetch the current weather details.  
- **Current Location Support**: Get weather updates based on your geolocation.  
- **Detailed Weather Data**:
  - Temperature and "Feels Like" temperature.  
  - Weather condition with an icon.  
  - Humidity, wind speed, and pressure readings.  
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a spinner while fetching weather data.  
- **Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly error messages for invalid city names or network issues.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.  

## Technology Stack  
- **HTML**: For structuring the application.  
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive layout.  
- **JavaScript**: For handling API calls, user interactions, and dynamic content updates.  
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching real-time weather data.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Replace the `apiKey` in `weather.js` with your OpenWeatherMap API key.  
3. Open the `weather.html` file in any modern browser.  
4. Use the input field to search for a city's weather or click "Use Current Location."  

## How It Works  
1. When a city is entered or the "Use Current Location" button is clicked, the app fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API.  
2. The app displays the weather information dynamically on the page.  
3. If an invalid city is entered or a location error occurs, a user-friendly error message is shown.
